# harlan_network_analysis

This code analyzes and visualizes a nutrient-sharing network of ants by creating a social graph where nodes represent individual ants, and edges represent interaction events, such as grooming and food sharing. It calculates centrality, eigenvector relationality, and betweenness centrality to demonstrate each ant's influence on the network.

Most of the base code you see here was written by Santiago Mensenes during his time as a PhD student at George Washington University, where I assisted in data collection, specimen tagging, and analysis. 

The second document, "Grooming_Analysis_24", was written entirely by me. This code contributes a second network analysis of grooming behaviors. By layering the two, we can see emerging patterns in multi-layer network analysis and examine the similarities between grooming and nutrient distribution behaviors.
